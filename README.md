# Electrophysiology Stimulation Visualization

**This is an archived project.**

Simple single-page jQuery/JS conversion between inter-pulse intervals/train burst widths and frequency/number of pulses &amp; plots an example waveform. Mostly useful for visualizing spike trains in discussions or double checking your math when hopping between ephys equipment.

Once you begin entering values, the example waveform will not plot until all values have been entered. You can choose between calculating your waveform from the inter-pulse period and the train burst width, or from the # of pulses and the frequency of those pulses – the alternate option will be displayed automatically. Scientific notation is displayed on the right for reference if you’re using a system that requires SN (AM Systems, yay).
